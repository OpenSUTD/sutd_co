#This is the compiled sources for the 'Events' page
#For the text segment, if multiple paragraphs are required, use a new '-para' property for each new paragraph
#Also, if your paragraph gets too long, use "-para: |", then newlines can be added in here for more convenient typing. You don't even need quotation marks in this case
#As with all YAML, you just need to be extrenely careful with the indentation

#IMPT: Please make sure all Event 'title' are unique!

            you can add newlines here in yaml to make it more convenient. 
            but it won't make a new paragraph.
        - para: |
            this is an example of a second paragraph.
