#             Our six SCMC2020 percussionists have recently be involved in a production done by World of Chnewse Traditions, presenting a piece which is called The Rodent's Wedding(老鼠娶亲)!
#             <br/>
#             <br/>
#             The Roden's Wedding(老鼠娶亲) is inspired by the Chinese folklore that goes by the same name as this piece
#             <br/>Folk Tales about 老鼠娶亲：
#             <br/>People believe that the third night of CHinese New Year is the time when mice marry their daughters. So, people will go to bed and rest earlier that night in case mice
#             get disturbed. They will also scatter some rice and cake in the corners as wedding gifts.
#             <br/>This folk tale shows poeple's hope to achieve a state of non-interface, coexistence in the relationship with mice. Celebrating the wedding of mice, who are fertile,
#             also expresses people's wish for the family to be prosperous in the following year.
#             <br/>
#             With fleible drumbeats and vivid performance, the piece illustrates a humorous and lively scene of the rodent's wedding.

            6 of our percussionists who represented SUTDCO-Percussion had recently participated in the ensemble category of the Singapore Chinese Music Competition 2020 organised by 
            Singapore Chinese Orchestra. We are pleased to share that our team was one of the 4 groups to progress into finals! Although our team fell short of a podium finish at the 
            end, we are proud that they had made it this far - they barely had 2 months to prepare when fifth rows were only allowed to resume with the new semester. 
            Many congratulations to Jianhui, Xiangyuan, Kewen, Wenling, Jing Wen and Phyllis for pulling it off in such a relatively short span of time! ⁣
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Also, we would like to thank:⁣

            <br/>(2) our instructor Mr Benjamin Boo for tirelessly guiding us throughout our journey, and ⁣
            <br/>(3) Reverberance who had given us lots of support in many ways!⁣

            <br/>

            part of the competition with them, and we enjoyed their performances from the backstage as well.
