# This is the compiled sources for the 'Events' page
# For the text segment, if multiple paragraphs are required, use a new '-para' property for each new paragraph
# Also, if your paragraph gets too long, use "-para: |", then newlines can be added in here for more convenient typing. You don't even need quotation marks in this case
# As with all YAML, you just need to be extremely careful with the indentation

# IMPT: Please make sure all Event 'title' are unique!
